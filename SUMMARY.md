**Sugar Beets 2016** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial domain. 



The dataset consists of 12527 images with 54595 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *sugar beet* and *weed*.

Images in the Sugar Beets 2016 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1553 (12% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 20 splits in the dataset: *CKA_weeds* (512 images), *CKA_160518* (305 images), *CKA_160510* (867 images), *CKA_160527* (300 images), *CKA_160503* (1570 images), *CKA_160504* (301 images), *CKA_160429* (614 images), *CKA_160511* (210 images), *CKA_160512* (304 images), *CKA_160509* (912 images), *CKA_160421* (823 images), *CKA_160505* (963 images), *CKA_160513* (301 images), *CKA_160428* (300 images), *CKA_160517* (307 images), *CKA_160506* (301 images), *CKA_160502* (302 images), *CKA_160426* (306 images), *CKA_160427* (881 images), and *CKA_160523* (2148 images). The dataset was released in 2016.
